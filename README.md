# Media-Organiser
This is a basic file explorer with added ability to:
  create playlists, 
  add categories to files, 
  assign photos as thumbnails to files, 
  add comments to files. 
  
 I completed this in Java for my Level 3 Apprenticeship synoptic project (and got a distinction). 
 
 To view, run the .jar file and type in the file path of mediaFiles folder found in this project.
